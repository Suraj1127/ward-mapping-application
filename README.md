# Ward Mapping Application

## Background
In the last few decades, Nepal has seen major political and structural changes of which 
federalism is the one. The process of splitting and merging of VDC/municipality wards 
has been going even before the federalism era but once federalism was introduced the 
structuring became totally different than what it was. From around 4000 VDC/municipalities, the merging/splitting 
process resulted in around 3300 VDC/municipalities before the federal structuring was done. 
Once federal structuring was done, the new level, Local Government Unit (LGU), was introduced 
which consisted of wards. Ward is the lowest level of new federal structure. 
As of now, there are 753 LGUs and 6743 wards of which detailed data per province 
(in GIS map) is given [here](http://103.69.124.141/).

The World Bank, Nepal Country Office, has produced ward-wise mappings from the old 
structure to new federal structure for its internal use and has made the mapping public 
in [GitHub](https://github.com/Suraj1127/nepal_wards_mapping). There are two separate mappings, one from 2011 structure to 2018 federal 
structure and another from 2014 structure to 2018 federal structure. 
In addition to the machine readable CSV files, the team has developed a simple 
application hosted on free hosting platform, Herokuapp, which is accessible to any normal
users without having to work with the CSV files.
